Octopress Blog: Blog for geek!

## Preparation Work

I suppose that you've installed such softwares before you start:

* git
* ruby with RVM

#### Clone Octopress Code

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
cd octopress    # If you use RVM, You'll be asked if you trust the .rvmrc file (say yes).
ruby --version  # Should report Ruby 1.9.3
bundle install  # Install what octopress need
rake install    # Install the default Octopress theme
```

Now you can type `rake preview` to preview the default octopress blog [here](localhost:4000).

#### Prepare Your Github Page

Create a new Github repository and name the repository with your user name or organization name `username.github.com` or `organization.github.com`. Just like this:   
![github page](http://www.lufeipic.tk/f/k/?.jpg)

Execute `rake setup_github_pages` and fill in your github page URL. You will then find a _deploy folder in your working directory which would be deployed remotely.
